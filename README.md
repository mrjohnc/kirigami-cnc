# kirigami-cnc
A CNC machine to mark, cut and fold paper

It is based around the design principles of: 

* Being as self replicating as practical
* All materials as accessible as possible to make it as easy to build and improve the design as possible
* Strong enough to allow the cutting of many materials
* To be easy to construct
* To be affordable

The project is inspired by the work of Sam Calisch at MIT

The current design is largely inspired by Maslow CNC, an open source CNC router with a design similar to a hanging plotter.
